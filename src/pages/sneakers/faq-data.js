                Founder's edition Heel, a DAW edition Heel. If you have 1 token of Ep2, you will be able to claim 1
                Gravity Heel and 1 Founder Heel, and if you have 5 tokens of Ep2, you will be able to claim 5 Gravity

                The DAW edition heel can be claimed by Ep2 holders, and by Desperate Ape Wives NFT holders. Each wallet
                can only claim 1 DAW edition regardless of how many Ep2 or DAW NFTs they have. The claim of this edition
                is based on first come first serve, with a max supply of 333.
