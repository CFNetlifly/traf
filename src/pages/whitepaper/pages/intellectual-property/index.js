            A TRAF token is similar to a sports card or a trading card in video form. When you buy an NFT of an episode, you donâ€™t own the intellectual property rights nor the commercial rights of the episode or of what the episode contains. Buying a TRAF token doesn't give the owner copyright ownership of the video or ownership of the TRAF characters or TRAF logos."
